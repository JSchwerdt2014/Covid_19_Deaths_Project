# **Covid-19 Underlying Conditions Project**

In this project we will be analyzing Covid-19 underlying conditions and risk factors. The main questions we want to anser in this project are as follows:

1. What condtion groups are most vulnderable?
2. Which subsection of said condition group is most vulerable?
3. What are the risk percentages of each age group?

## **Cleaning the Data with Python**

Importing the csv in Jupyter Notebooks

Removing rows we won't be using

## **Analyzing the Data with Python**

Getting a sum of deaths per condition group

Creating a sum percentage of deaths per condition group

Looking at respiratory because it is our leading condition catagory for deaths

Breaking respiratory by percent to easily identify leading causes

Taking a look at what age groups are at risk by percent of total
